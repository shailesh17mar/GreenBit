GREENBIT - MAKE IT GROW!!
We aim an innovative smart technology that eliminates the hassle from gardening as we know it and enables anybody to grow their own food and plants from their mobile and web interface remotely indoor making it simple, fun and interactive. It’ll water them, feed them and make sure they have optimal growing conditions 24/7. Just sit back, relax and watch your plants thrive, knowing that everything is being taken care of.
The project consist of 3 parts:
1. Intel Galileo
2. Android App
3. Web Browser
Intel Galileo will be acting as a data acquisition system, gathering all the data from the plant and its periphery, processing it and sending out to the server in real time. It’ll be monitoring parameters like Temperature, Light, Moisture and Humidity of and around the plant. 
The system will be having sensors like, Light Dependent Sensor (LDR), Temperature sensor, Humidity sensor to monitor the all the parameters. There will be a simplified relay system to control the lighting, water and temperature conditions around the plant. All the processed data will be sent to the server where it’ll be saved in a database which probably will be running on Galileo.
Once the data is received by the server it’ll be further processed for plotting the graphs of all the parameters and monitoring other systems. 
The web browser based micro-site and Android app will comprise following sections:
Monitoring
Preset Controls
Manual control 
Tweet
Messaging
Snap
System can operate in two modes: a) Autonomous	b) Preset
Track the Progress! Monitor their current statues and living conditions in form of graphs.
Tap and Grow! Just tell the app what you want to grow and watch it load pre-programmed settings for your plant.
Show some Love! Set the parameters and living conditions for the plant and see them follow your instructions.  
Tweet! With on click of a Tweet button, tweet the health and living conditions around the plant on your twitter account.
Get Alerts! Get notified if any parameter goes out of the optimal values.
Snap! With on click of a button, take the picture of plant and living conditions around the plant on your twitter account.

Sensors and its objectives:
Light Sensor
This will be used to monitor if the light around the plant is optimal or not and further it’ll be synced with the clock to emulate conditions like sunrise and sunset. It’ll also keep on monitoring whether the light is working or not. If it is not working then system will send an alert message to the owner.
Temperature Sensor
Temperature sensor will monitor the temperature around the plant. The temperature sensor will also ultimately be used to switch a fan ON to control the temperature. Depending upon the mode it’ll regulate the temperature to emulate the best conditions for plant to grow.
Moisture Sensor
Measure the moisture levels in the soil to trigger the water pumm that will water the plants. 

System End Goal: 
1) Measure temperature and light in the grow space and outside, mostly because the data should be interesting and defines the environment in and around the grow space. Values to be saved in a database and be graphed on a web browser and app. 
2) Switch a light system on and off on a configurable timetable to emulate sun.
3) Measure soil moisture. Measure the moisture content in two pots and may even look into setting up checks for possible water overflow or leaks, as a control measure and switch on a water pump ON for a period of time to water the plants, when moisture levels drop below a certain threshold.
4) Control the temperature with the use of a fan.
5) USB Camera to remotely monitor the plant. 
6) Website for remote access and control.
